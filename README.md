### Intro
g-fu is a pragmatic [Lisp](https://xkcd.com/297/) developed and embedded in Go. The initial [release](https://github.com/codr7/g-fu/tree/master/v1) implements an extensible, tree-walking interpreter with support for quasi-quotation and macros, lambdas, tail-call optimization, opt-/varargs, threads and channels; all weighing in below 2 kloc.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/codr7/g-fu.git
$ cd g-fu/v1
$ go build src/gfu.go
$ rlwrap ./gfu
g-fu v1.8

  (let (fib (fun (n)
              (if (< n 2)
                n
                (+ (fib (- n 1)) (fib (- n 2))))))
    (dump (fib 20)))

```

### Macros
One of the most common macro examples is the `while`-loop. The example below defines it in terms of a more general `loop`-macro, which will follow shortly. Note that g-fu uses `%` as opposed to `,` for interpolating values, `_` in place of `nil` and `..` to splat.

```
  (let while (macro (cond body..)
    '(loop
       (if %cond _ (break))
       %body..)))

  (let (i 0)
    (while (< i 7)
      (dump i)
      (inc i)))

0
1
2
3
4
5
6
```

`loop` supports exiting with a result using `break` within its body, which is trapped by a nested macro. Most of the hard work is performed by an anonymous, tail-recursive function; fresh argument symbols are created to avoid capturing the calling environment.

```
  (let loop (macro (body..)
    (let done (g-sym) result (g-sym))
  
    '(let (break (macro (args..) '(recall T %args..)))
       ((fun ((%done F) %result..)
          (if %done %result.. (do %body.. (recall))))))))

  (dump (loop (dump 'foo) (break 'bar) (dump 'baz)))

'foo
'bar
```

### Tasks
Tasks are first class, preemptive green threads that run in separate environments and interact with the outside world using channels. New tasks are started using `task` which optionally takes a channel or buffer size argument and returns the new task. `wait` may be used to wait for task completion and get the results.

```
  (let (t1 (task _ (dump 'foo) 'bar)
        t2 (task _ (dump 'baz) 'qux))
    (dump (wait t1 t2)))

baz
foo
(bar qux)
```

The defining environment is cloned; and may be read, but not modified by the task.

```
  (let (v 42
        t (task _ (inc v)))
    (dump (wait t))
    (dump v))

43
42
```

#### Channels
Channels are optionally buffered thread-safe queues, new channels may be created using `chan`.

```
  (chan 10)

(Chan 0xc00005a240)
```

Unbuffered channels are useful for synchronizing tasks. The following example starts with the main task (which is unbuffered by default) `post`-ing itself to the newly started task `t`, which then replies `'foo` and finally returns `'bar`

```
  (let (t (task _
            (post (fetch) 'foo)
            'bar))
    (post t (this-task))
    (dump (fetch))
    (dump (wait t)))

foo
bar
```

### Profiling
CPU profiling may be enabled by passing `-prof` on the command line; results are written to the specified file, `fib_tail.prof` in the following example.

```
$ ./gfu -prof fib_tail.prof bench/fib_tail.gf

$ go tool pprof fib_tail.prof
