## g-fu

### Intro
g-fu is a Lisp-like interpreted language developed in Go. The language is developed in stages, resulting in increasingly elaborate dialects of the same basic language. Dialects may be considered frozen in time except for back ported bug fixes and refactorings. The initial [dialect](https://github.com/codr7/g-fu/tree/master/v1) weighs in at 1 kloc and implements a trivial evaluator to the point where it can run a REPL and calculate the Fibonacci sequence.
