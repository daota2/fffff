### Intro
g-fu is a practical [Lisp](https://xkcd.com/297/) developed and embedded in Go. The initial [release](https://github.com/codr7/g-fu/tree/master/v1) weighs in at 1 kloc and implements a basic, extensible, tree-walking interpreter.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/codr7/g-fu.git
$ cd g-fu/v1
$ go build src/gfu.go
$ rlwrap ./gfu
g-fu v1.5

  (let (fib (fun (n)
              (if (< n 2)
                n
                (+ (fib (- n 1)) (fib (- n 2))))))
    (dump (fib 20)))

```

### Macros
One of the most common macro examples is the `while`-loop. The example below defines it in terms of a more general `loop`-macro, which will follow shortly. Note that g-fu uses `%` as opposed to `,` for interpolating values, `_` in place of `nil` and `..` to splat values.

```
  (let while (macro (cond body..)
         '(loop
           (if %cond _ (break))
           %body..)))

  (let (i 0)
    (while (< i 7)
      (dump i)
      (inc i)))

0
1
2
3
4
5
6
```

`loop` allows exiting with a result by calling `break` anywhere within the body. Most of the hard work is performed by an anonymous, tail-recursive function. A locally scoped macro is used to trap `break`-calls and a fresh symbol is allocated for the variable `break-args` to prevent potentially capturing the calling environment.

```
  (let loop (macro (body..)
         (let break-args (Sym))
         '(let (break (macro (args..)
                  '(recall %args..)))
            ((fun (%(break-args)?)
               (or %break-args (do %body.. (recall))))
             _))))

  (dump (loop (dump 'foo) (break 'bar) (dump 'baz)))

'foo
'bar
```

### Profiling
CPU profiling may be enabled by passing `-prof` on the command line; results are written to the specified file, `fib_rec.prof` in this case.

```
$ ./gfu -prof fib_rec.prof bench/fib_rec.gf

$ go tool pprof fib_rec.prof
