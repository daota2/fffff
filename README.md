## g-fu

### Intro
g-fu is a Lisp-like language developed and embedded in Go. Implementation is divided into stages, each culminating in a dialect that may be considered frozen in time except for the occasional bug fix / refactoring. The initial [dialect](https://github.com/codr7/g-fu/tree/master/v1) weighs in at 1 kloc and implements a trivial evaluator to the point where it can run a REPL and calculate the Fibonacci sequence.
